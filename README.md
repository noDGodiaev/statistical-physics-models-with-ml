# Toolkit-for-assessing-the-critical-behavior-of-statistical-physics-models-with-ml

This repo related to Study [project](https://cabinet.miem.hse.ru/#/project/329/info/2020) in faculty of the [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/) - [Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics](https://miem.hse.ru/).

## The main idea
Check the applicability of neural networks for determining the critical temperature in square two-dimensional two-component crystal lattices. Compare different approaches to training a deep neural network and determine appropriate metrics
